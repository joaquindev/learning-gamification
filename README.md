learning-gamification
=====================

This is a repo for the things I'm going to learn in the [Coursera Gamification Course][url-gamification-course]. 

This is a business course, not technical or design workshop. 

Index of things I have already read: 

1.1 Introduction 

Gamification: learning from games, understanding what makes the game sucessful. Applying this to other area. 

1.2 Course overview

Learning goals. 4 things: 1. what is gamification 2. why it might be valuable 3. how to do it effectively 4. specific applications

New method: Open Online Delivery. Gamification is a brand new concept, it is only a couple years old. 

1.3 Definition of Gamification

Definition: The use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game context

Example: Nike plus, a device that communicates and collects data, telling how fast you've run, compare yourself to previous times, you can also establish goals and trophies and medals. Also, compete againts friends. 

Example: Zombies Run! The goal is to get you to take the phone and as you are running, the game says that you are running away from the zombies. You can get special powers, and you're friends can also play.

GAME ELEMENTS: A game has graphical interface and pieces and so on. If we looke below the surface we see:
  Points: 
  Levels:
  Quests:
  Resources:
  Progression:
  Avatars:
  Social Graphs:

These are bits and pieces that make up the experience. They are parts of the game that we can reuse. We can also do this with service that are not games. Gamefied services.

GAME DESIGN TECHNIQUES

Games are just not the elements. More to games than elements. Games are things that are design for the purpose of being fun. It's not a matter of pure engineering but there's also an artistic experience that involved taking an approach different. 

Some objective other than success in the game.
